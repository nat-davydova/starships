# Star Wars Starships Comparison App (React, SCSS)

The App grabs a list of Star Wars V starships from the server (via SWAPI) and allows to chose 2 or more ships and compare them via different criteria.

If any parameter is the largest - it's of green color in the comparison table, if it's the smallest one - of red color, if we have only 2 starships and one of their parameters is equal, it is of blue color.
